# Toy  raytracer in C++ (circa 2003)

This is a super old project, probably my first real C++ project ever. Can load an .OBJ file and raytrace it.<br>
The initial version was only able to trace spheres with a color and specular attribute. The specular reflections were most probably wrong.<br>
_It is presented here for archival purpose only._
